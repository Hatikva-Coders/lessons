i thought we said we weren't going to talk about function defintions yet. 
i'd rather we first just discuss functions as a 'given block of functionallity'. (see slide 5)

also - i think it's very important to talk about the re-use part of functions. they're not only there for encapsulation (although that is
important), but also for code re-use, and i think the kids will connect to that better.
